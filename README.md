# Mini AI Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of **mini AI-based projects** developed during my **CodTech Internship (Artificial Intelligence Domain)**. The purpose of these projects is to gain hands-on experience with AI concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and strengthen practical implementation using web technologies and Python.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

* Understand basic Artificial Intelligence concepts
* Apply logic building using real-world inspired problems
* Integrate simple AI ideas with frontend technologies
* Improve hands-on coding and project structuring skills

  ## Tasks Included
- Task 1: Text Summarization Tool
- Task 2: Speech Recognition System
- Task 3: Neural Style Transfer
- Task 4: Generative Text Model

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend / Logic Reference:** Python
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project is organized in a separate folder and contains:

* `index.html` – Structure of the project
* `style.css` – Styling and UI design
* `script.js` – Core logic and interactivity
* `README` / comments – Explanation of functionality

## ▶️ How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shalinikumari6485/Mini-Project-AI-.git
   ```
2. Open any project folder
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Improved understanding of AI workflows
* Enhanced frontend and logic-building skills
* Practical exposure to version control using GitHub
* Better project documentation and structuring

These projects demonstrate practical implementation of AI concepts using frontend technologies.
